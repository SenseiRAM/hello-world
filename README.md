# hello-world

Hi there,

My name is Richard Mitchell, and I'm doing my best to learn Github. Do people generally just type github in lower-case, or what?

Anywho, I worked at Joystiq.com from 2006 through its untimely demise in early 2015. I wrote about and reviewed video games, for a living. I've interviewed lots of game industry big shots. I've been to GDC multiple times, E3 2006-2015, the Tokyo Game Show, GDC Europe and Gamescom. Since Joystiq fell, I've helped organize the XPO Game Festival in my hometown of Tulsa, Oklahoma. We had our first event in September 2016, and it went over well (xpotulsa.com). Now, I'm gearing up for XPO 2017. I'm also working to improve Tulsa's tech scene and establish an independent game development scene. And maybe learn to write code.
